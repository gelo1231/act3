    <h2>The world of college intramural sports awaits.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="image"></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p id="paragraph">For many students, being out of high school and on a college campus marks the first time they're
      no longer involved in club sports or organized competitions. Many are also looking for college activities to meet
      new people.</p>
    <h1>What are Intramurals?</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">University-specific sports leagues, events, and tournaments that take place only on campus are known as intramurals.
      Intramurals provide a different experience from Rockhurst's NCAA Division II teams, which play intercollegiate sports
      versus other colleges, frequently with athletes on athletic scholarships. These student-run competitions are designed
      to offer fun, relaxation, and physical activity in a relaxed yet structured environment. Essentially, intramural sports
      create a venue for students to play sports for fun, fitness, and friendship inside the university, whereas
      intercollegiate sports serve as an official and frequently scholarship-driven athletic platform.
      </p>
    <h1>Types of Intramural Sports</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">Rockhurst offers co-ed leagues, activities, and tournaments in a wide range of team sports and
      competitions. They include:</p>
    <div class="sport">
      <ol>
        <li>Soccer</li>
        <li>Basketball (5v5 indoor, 3v3 outdoor)</li>
        <li>Volleyball</li>
        <li>Sand volleyball</li>
        <li>Flag football</li>
        <li>Dodgeball</li>
        <li>Ping pong</li>
        <li>Tennis (singles and doubles)</li>
        <li>Cornhole</li>
        <li>Kickball</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p id="paragraph">Donâ€™t see anything for you? Suggest it! Core sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball) are offered
      each season. Additional sports are added at various times throughout the academic year.</p>
    <h1>How Do Intramural Sports Work?</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">Students can freely register individually or as a team for various sports activities, with no associated costs. Registration can be completed on the IM Leagues Home Page.
      Game schedules are available online, and matches take place at different locations such as Burke Field, the area behind Corcoran Hall, inside the Convocation Center, or on the tennis courts.
      Teams are also encouraged to hold their own practices without any official commitments.
